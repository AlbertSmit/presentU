  presentU's Gatsby rebirth.
</h1>

Once upon a time, when I was asked to make a website, I decided to go with WebFlow.

Now, a year later, the time has come. It is time to get presentU to the next level. The JAM-Stack level, that is. Site will now be tied to a CMS (possibly Contentful or Prismic), and made in Gatsby, to profit from modularity and speed.

Work in progress.

## ðŸš€ Quick start

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/AlbertSmit/presentU.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the default starter.

    ```sh
    # create a new Gatsby site using the default starter
    gatsby new my-default-starter https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd my-default-starter/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `my-default-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
